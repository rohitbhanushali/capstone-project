Managing cloud infrastructure manually is error-prone, time-consuming, and not scalable for modern
applications like an Uber clone that demands high availability, security, and fault tolerance.
Traditional infrastructure provisioning lacks consistency, version control, and rapid recovery options
in case of failures.

There is a need to automate the creation of a highly available, secure, and scalable AWS architecture
using Terraform — an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. This infrastructure must include:
• Public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance.
• A secure internet gateway for controlled public access.
• Private subnets for application servers and databases with restricted access.
• Deployment of AWS services like RDS (with Read Replica for high availability) within private
networks.
• Proper use of routing tables, NAT gateways, and security groups to enforce strict network
security policies.

The infrastructure must be modular, repeatable, and easily manageable, ensuring:
• Faster deployment cycles.
• Reduced human errors.
• Improved security posture.
• Cost optimization.
• High availability for mission-critical applications.
